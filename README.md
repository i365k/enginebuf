# Engine Buffers

This is the buffer period of a game engine. You can use it to establish communication between game engines. Through the codec, you can encode the items it supports into a binary stream. At the same time, other game engines can also decode this binary stream to get the corresponding Configuration file.

Currently we support the codec of the story engine, you can use it conveniently.

If you want to use it in other engines, you can always contact us: i365khs@gmail.com.

You can also submit a PR, we will carefully review your code, and welcome you to become a member of the engine buffer.
